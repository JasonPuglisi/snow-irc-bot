These scripts are meant for use with systemd or similar. Your
SNOW\_IRC\_BOT\_PATH environment variable should be set to the bot's working
directory, which is one level above this one.

This is a forking process, and the scripts you'll want to use are `start.sh`
and `stop.sh`. The scripts `run.sh` and `kill.sh` are used in the background,
and shouldn't be executed directly.
